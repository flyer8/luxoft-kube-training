# Liveness Probe

1. Get familiar with `pods/probes/probe-liveness-task.yaml`.

2. Start Pod and check the its status. It should not be ready:

```console
$ kubectl create -f pods/probes/probe-liveness-task.yaml
pod/probe-liveness-task

$ kubectl logs pod/probe-liveness-task -f
2021.06.06 09:33:54 Starting
2021.06.06 09:33:54 --> Started!
got TERM but ignored
2021.06.06 09:34:08 Bye

$ kubectl get events -w | grep -i probe-liveness-task
> kubectl get events -w | findstr /i probe-liveness-task

0s  Normal   Scheduled  pod/probe-liveness-task  Successfully assigned msuslov/probe-liveness-task to minikube
0s  Normal   Pulled     pod/probe-liveness-task  Container image "bash" already present on machine
0s  Normal   Created    pod/probe-liveness-task  Created container bash
0s  Normal   Started    pod/probe-liveness-task  Started container bash

0s  Warning  Unhealthy  pod/probe-liveness-task  Liveness probe failed:
0s  Normal   Killing    pod/probe-liveness-task  Stopping container bash
```

3. Add Liveness Probe's `exec` handler:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        source /app/echotime.sh
        if [ ! -e /tmp/liveness ]; then
          echotime Liveness FAILED >> /app/my.log
          exit 1
        fi
        echotime Liveness OK >> /app/my.log
        exit 0
```

4. Tune probe's parameters for different test cases:

| initialDelaySeconds | failureThreshold | periodSeconds |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 1                   | 2                | 5             |
| 6                   | 4                | 2             |

What are expected results?

5. Start Pod (`kubectl create`) and check the its logs (`kubectl logs`) and events.

What's changed?

6. Clean up.

## Solution

2. Start Pod and check the its status. It should not be ready:

```console
$ kubectl create -f pods/probes/probe-liveness-task.yaml
pod/probe-liveness-task

$ kubectl logs pod/probe-liveness-task -f
2021.06.06 09:33:54 Starting
2021.06.06 09:33:54 --> Started!
got TERM but ignored
2021.06.06 09:34:08 Bye

$ kubectl get events -w | grep -i probe-liveness-task
0s          Normal    Scheduled   pod/probe-liveness-task   Successfully assigned msuslov/probe-liveness-task to minikube
0s          Normal    Pulled      pod/probe-liveness-task   Container image "bash" already present on machine
0s          Normal    Created     pod/probe-liveness-task   Created container bash
0s          Normal    Started     pod/probe-liveness-task   Started container bash
0s          Warning   Unhealthy   pod/probe-liveness-task   Liveness probe failed:
0s          Warning   Unhealthy   pod/probe-liveness-task   Liveness probe failed:
0s          Normal    Killing     pod/probe-liveness-task   Stopping container bash

$ kubectl get pods -w | grep -i probe-liveness-task
probe-liveness-task   0/1     Pending   0          0s
probe-liveness-task   0/1     Pending   0          0s
probe-liveness-task   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
probe-liveness-task   1/1     Running             0          2s
probe-liveness-task   0/1     Completed           0          16s
```

3. Add Liveness Probe's `exec` handler:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        source /app/echotime.sh
        if [ ! -e /tmp/liveness ]; then
          echotime Liveness FAILED >> /app/my.log
          exit 1
        fi
        echotime Liveness OK >> /app/my.log
        exit 0
```

4. Tune probe's parameters for different test cases:

| initialDelaySeconds | failureThreshold | periodSeconds |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 1                   | 2                | 5             |
| 6                   | 4                | 2             |

What are expected results?

Because probe will start failing after 20 seconds then:

Case 1:

| Time | Probe | State       |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1    | OK    | Working     |
| 6    | OK    | Working     |
| 11   | OK    | Working     |
| 16   | OK    | Working     |
| 21   | NOK   | Working     |
| 26   | NOK   | Terminating |

Case 2: on 6+4*2=14 second, probe should succeed.

| Time | Probe | State       |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 6    | OK    | Working     |
| 8    | OK    | Working     |
| 10   | OK    | Working     |
| 12   | OK    | Working     |
| 14   | OK    | Working     |
| 16   | OK    | Working     |
| 18   | OK    | Working     |
| 20   | OK    | Working     |
| 22   | NOK   | Working     |
| 24   | NOK   | Working     |
| 26   | NOK   | Working     |
| 28   | NOK   | Terminating |

1. Start Pod (`kubectl create`) and check the its logs (`kubectl logs`) and events.
