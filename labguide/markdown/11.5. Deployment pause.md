# Deployment Pause

1. Pause your deployment imperatively.
2. Update the deployment imperatively:

   - set container image to `nginx:1.19.3`
   - set limits to `cpu=200m,memory=100Mi`
   - provide a change cause

3. Resume your deployment.
4. Check the history of rollout (you must see only one new revision)

## Solution

1. Pause your deployment imperatively.

```console
$ kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused
```

2. Update the deployment imperatively:

   - set container image to `nginx:1.19.3`
   - set limits to `cpu=200m,memory=100Mi`
   - provide a change cause

```console
$ kubectl set image deploy nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.19.3
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
```

Deployment will hanging:

```console
$ kubectl rollout status deploy nginx-deployment
Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 0 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
^C
```

Do other requiered changes:

```console
$ kubectl set resources deploy nginx-deployment --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updated

$ kubectl annotate deploy nginx-deployment "kubernetes.io/change-cause=image updated to 1.19.3"
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment annotated
```

There is still no changes in history:

```console
$ kubectl rollout history deploy nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
3         image updated to 1.18.0
5         image updated to 1.16.1
6         image updated to 1.19.6
```

3. Resume your deployment.

```console
$ kubectl rollout resume deploy nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed
```

4. Check the history of rollout (you must see only one new revision)

```console
$ kubectl rollout history deploy nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
3         image updated to 1.18.0
5         image updated to 1.16.1
6         image updated to 1.19.6
7         image updated to 1.19.3
```

New revision 7 has appeared.
