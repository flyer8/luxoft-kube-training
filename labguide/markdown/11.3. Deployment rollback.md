# Deployment Rollback

1. List the history of your deployment.
2. Rollback to a revision (select by your own).
3. Check the numeration in revision history (you must see the gap)

## Solution

1. List the history of your deployment:

```console
$ kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         image updated to 1.16.1
3         image updated to 1.18.0
4         image updated to 1.19.6
```

2. Rollback to a revision (select by your own):

```console
$ kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back
```

3. Check the numeration in revision history (you must see the gap):

```console
$ kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
3         image updated to 1.18.0
4         image updated to 1.19.6
5         image updated to 1.16.1
```

Yes, number 2 revision has turned to 5.
