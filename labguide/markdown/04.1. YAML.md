# YAML files

1. Create a list of values `uno`, `due`, `tre`

2. Create a map of values
  `cucumber -> green`, `plum -> purple`, `apple -> red`

3. Create a map of list with values
  `Hulk -> (Bruce, Banner)`,
  `Black Widow -> (Natasha, Romanoff)`,
  `Spider-Man -> (Peter, Parker)`

4. Use a specification for multiline-command pod:

```yaml
# yaml/pod-test-command.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-test-command
spec:
  containers:
    - name: busybox-container
      image: busybox
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - echo Put commands here
  restartPolicy: Never
```

5. Run the Pod and check its logs:

```console
$ kubectl create -f yaml/pod-test-command.yaml
pod/pod-test-command created

$ kubectl logs pod-test-command
Put commands here

$ kubectl delete pod pod-test-command
pod "pod-test-command" deleted
```

6. Create a block containing the following commands (no new line at the end):

```bash
echo Start
for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo In Progress $i...
  sleep 1
done
echo Finish
```

and paste it in your pod instead of `echo Fix me` message. You should see the following message during the Pod execution:

```console
$ kubectl logs pod-test-command
Start
In Progress 1...
In Progress 2...
In Progress 3...
Finish
```

## Solution

1. Create a list of values `uno`, `due`, `tre`

```yaml
- uno
- due
- tre
```

2. Create a map of values
  `cucumber -> green`, `plum -> purple`, `apple -> red`

```yaml
cucumber: green
plum: purple
apple: red
```

3. Create a map of list with values
  `Hulk -> (Bruce, Banner)`,
  `Black Widow -> (Natasha, Romanoff)`,
  `Spider-Man -> (Peter, Parker)`

```yaml
Hulk:
  - Bruce
  - Banner
Black Widow:
 - Natasha
 - Romanoff
Spider-Man: ["Peter", "Parker"]
```

4. Updated specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-test-command
spec:
  containers:
    - name: busybox-container
      image: busybox
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - |-
          echo Start
          for i in 1 2 3; do
            echo In Progress $i...
            sleep 1
          done
          echo Finish
  restartPolicy: Never
```

5. Run the Pod and check its logs:

```console
$ kubectl create -f yaml/pod-test-command.yaml
pod/pod-test-command created

$ kubectl logs pod-test-command
Start
In Progress 1...
In Progress 2...
In Progress 3...
Finish

$ kubectl delete pod pod-test-command
pod "pod-test-command" deleted
```

6. Create a block containing the following commands (no new line at the end):

```bash
echo Start
for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo In Progress $i...
  sleep 1
done
echo Finish
```

and paste it in your pod instead of `echo Fix me` message. You should see the following message during the Pod execution:

```console
$ kubectl logs pod-test-command
Start
In Progress 1...
In Progress 2...
In Progress 3...
Finish
```
