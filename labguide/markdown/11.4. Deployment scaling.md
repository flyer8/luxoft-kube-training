# Deployment Scaling

1. Scale your deployment to zeros replicas and back imperatively?

ðŸ¤” What is use-case for scaling down to zero and back?

2. Scale your deployment declaratively.

3. Scale current ReplicaSet of your Deployment to any number.

ðŸ¤” What's happened? Why?

## Solution

1. Scale your deployment to zeros replicas and back imperatively?

```console
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=0
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled

$ kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=10
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

ðŸ¤” What is use-case for scaling down to zero and back?

You remove workloads while keeping their controller:

- it keeps history of changes, you can rollback any revision
- you can restart pods again (e.g. if image was updated but has the same name)

2. Scale your deployment declaratively.

```diff
 apiVersion: apps/v1
 kind: Deployment
 metadata:
   name: nginx-deployment
   annotations:
     kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to 1.19.6
 spec:
   minReadySeconds: 2
-  replicas: 10
+  replicas: 0
   strategy:
     rollingUpdate:
       maxSurge: 20%
       maxUnavailable: 20%
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: nginx
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: nginx:1.19.6
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/nginx-deploy.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment configured
```

It requires more actions to do than imperative technique.

3. Scale current ReplicaSet of your Deployment to any number.

ðŸ¤” What's happened? Why?

Get information about current ReplicaSets:

```console
$ kubectl get rs
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-559d658b74   0         0         0       23m
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5   0         0         0       23m
nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9   0         0         0       22m
nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d   10        10        10      22m
```

Scale the active ReplicaSet:

```console
$ kubectl scale rs nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d --replicas=5
replicaset.apps/nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d scaled

$ kubectl get rs
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-559d658b74   0         0         0       23m
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5   0         0         0       24m
nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9   0         0         0       23m
nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d   10        10        5       23m
```

Deployment scale the ReplicaSet back to 10. After a little delay, there are all 10 pods are running:

```console
$ kubectl get rs
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-559d658b74   0         0         0       23m
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5   0         0         0       24m
nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9   0         0         0       23m
nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d   10        10        10      23m
```
