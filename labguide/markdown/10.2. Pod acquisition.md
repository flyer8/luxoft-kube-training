# Non-Template Pod Acquisitions

1. Create Pods from `rs/frontend-pod.yaml`.

2. Create ReplicaSets from `rs/frontend-rs.yaml`.

3. Check that Pods have been owned by the ReplicaSet:

  - In Pods check `metadata.ownerReferences` field
  - In ReplicaSet `metadata.uid` field

4. Delete ReplicaSet.

5. Check that all Pods owned by ReplicaSet were deleted as well.

```console
$ kubectl get pods [-n <namespace>] <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'
```

## Solution

1. Create Pods from `rs/frontend-pod.yaml`.

```console
$ kubectl create -f rs/frontend-pod.yaml
pod/busy124 created
pod/busy132 created
```

2. Create ReplicaSets from `rs/frontend-rs.yaml`.

```console
$ kubectl create -f rs/frontend-rs.yaml
replicaset.apps/frontend created
```

3. Check that Pods have been owned by the ReplicaSet:

  - In Pods check `metadata.ownerReferences` field
  - In ReplicaSet `metadata.uid` field

```console
$ kubectl get pod busy124 busy132 -o yaml | yq e '.items.[].metadata.ownerReferences' -
- apiVersion: apps/v1
  blockOwnerDeletion: true
  controller: true
  kind: ReplicaSet
  name: frontend
  uid: 37748045-e693-4056-ab2b-58467fb7e716
- apiVersion: apps/v1
  blockOwnerDeletion: true
  controller: true
  kind: ReplicaSet
  name: frontend
  uid: 37748045-e693-4056-ab2b-58467fb7e716

$ kubectl get rs frontend -o yaml | yq e .metadata.uid -
37748045-e693-4056-ab2b-58467fb7e716
```

4. Delete ReplicaSet.

```console
$ kubectl delete rs frontend
replicaset.apps "frontend" deleted
```

5. Check that all Pods owned by ReplicaSet were deleted as well.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'
$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```
