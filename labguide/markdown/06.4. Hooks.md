# hooks

There is a few challenges:

* hooks have own shell, and their output isn't shown in the logs
* there is a delay between operations due to asynchronous nature of Kubernetes
* shell runs another process, thus signals are not forwarded to the process

ðŸ¤” How to overcome them?

1. Get familiar with `pods/hooks/hook-task.yaml`.

2. Start Pod and check the its logs in the first terminal:

```console
$ kubectl create -f pods/hooks/hook-task.yaml
pod/hook-task created

$ kubectl logs hook-task -f
2021.06.06 09:24:24 Starting
```

3. In the second terminal, stop Pod the check its termination time:

```console
$ time kubectl delete pod hook-task
```

Check the output in the first terminal.

4. Specify `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to `20`.

5. Recreate the Pod and check termination time. How long is it?

<!-- 5. Yes it should be less for 10 seconds. -->

6. Update preStop hook by pasting the command:

```bash
touch /app/terminate.me
```

7. Start and stop the Pod again. Check the termination time again. How long is it?

Did the message `PreStop Hook` appear in the `kubectl logs`? If not, why and hot to achieve this?

8. Force delete the Pod. Have you seen the the message from `preStop` hook?

```console
$ kubectl delete pod hook-task --force
```

## Solution

There is a few challenges:

* hooks have own shell, and their output isn't shown in the logs
* there is a delay between operations due to asynchronous nature of Kubernetes
* shell runs another process, thus signals are not forwarded to the process

ðŸ¤” How to overcome them?

- Redirect output from hook to main process.
- Take into account that it could be longer than expected.
- Don't use signals


2. Start Pod and check the its logs in the first terminal:

```console
$ kubectl create -f pods/hooks/hook-task.yaml
pod/hook-task created

$ kubectl logs hook-task -f
2021.06.06 09:24:24 Starting
```

3. In the second terminal, stop Pod the check its termination time:

```console
$ time kubectl delete pod hook-task
pod "hook-task" deleted

real    0m33.610s
user    0m0.147s
sys     0m0.040s
```

Check the output in the first terminal:

```console
$ kubectl logs hook-task -f
2021.06.11 08:39:53 Starting
got TERM but ignored
```

4. Specify `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to `20`.

```yaml
...
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 20
...
```

5. Recreate the Pod and check termination time. How long is it?

| 30    | 20    |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0m33s | 0m24s |
| 1m21s | 1m7s  |
| 0m34s | 0m36s |
| 1m23s | 1m16s |

<!-- 5. Yes it should be less for 10 seconds. -->

6. Update preStop hook by pasting the command:

```bash
touch /app/terminate.me
```

7. Start and stop the Pod again. Check the termination time again. How long is it?

0m6s
0m15s
0m11s
0m12s
0m8s


Did the message `PreStop Hook` appear in the `kubectl logs`? If not, why and hot to achieve this?

No:

```console
$ kubectl logs hook-task -f
2021.06.11 09:05:45 Starting
got TERM but ignored
2021.06.11 09:05:52 Bye
```

Change handler:


```bash
echo PreStop Hook > /app/my.log
sleep 0.6
touch /app/terminate.me
```

Then it appears:

```console
$ kubectl logs hook-task -f
2021.06.11 09:09:48 Starting
PreStop Hook
got TERM but ignored
2021.06.11 09:09:59 Bye
```

8. Force delete the Pod. Have you seen the the message from `preStop` hook?

```console
$ kubectl delete pod hook-task --force
```

No, message isn't appear because hook isn't called:

```console
$ kubectl logs hook-task -f
2021.06.11 09:12:46 Starting
got TERM but ignored
```
