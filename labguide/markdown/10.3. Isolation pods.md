# Isolating Pods from a ReplicaSet

1. Create ReplicaSets from `rs/frontend-rs.yaml`.
2. Select one Pod and modify its labels to isolate from the ReplicaSet.
3. Check that new Pod has been created.
4. Delete the ReplicaSets.
5. Check that isolated Pod is still working but others are removed.
6. Delete the isolated Pod.

## Solution

1. Create ReplicaSets from `rs/frontend-rs.yaml`.

```console
$ kubectl create -f rs/frontend-rs.yaml
replicaset.apps/frontend created
```

2. Select one Pod and modify its labels to isolate from the ReplicaSet.

```console
$ kubectl get pods --show-labels
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
frontend-lcb9v   1/1     Running   0          12s   tier=frontend
frontend-xc4k7   1/1     Running   0          12s   tier=frontend
frontend-zj4dg   1/1     Running   0          12s   tier=frontend

$ kubectl label pod/frontend-lcb9v tier=backend --overwrite
pod/frontend-lcb9v labeled
```

3. Check that new Pod has been created.

```console
$ kubectl get pods --show-labels
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
frontend-2zhbk   1/1     Running   0          5s    tier=frontend
frontend-lcb9v   1/1     Running   0          46s   tier=backend
frontend-xc4k7   1/1     Running   0          46s   tier=frontend
frontend-zj4dg   1/1     Running   0          46s   tier=frontend
```

Pod `frontend-2zhbk` has been created.

4. Delete the ReplicaSets.

```console
$ kubectl delete rs frontend
replicaset.apps "frontend" deleted
```

5. Check that isolated Pod is still working but others are removed.

```console
$ kubectl get pods --show-labels
NAME             READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
frontend-lcb9v   1/1     Running       0          29m   tier=backend
```

6. Delete the isolated Pod.

```console
$ kubectl delete pod frontend-lcb9v
pod "frontend-lcb9v" deleted
```
