# Deployment Creation

1. Create a deployment using `deploy/nginx-deploy.yaml`.
2. Investigate created ReplicaSet:

  a) Put attention on the ReplicaSet name. What is its suffix? Is it the same `66b6c48dd5`? Why?
  b) What labels does it have?

3. Investigate created Pods:

  a) What suffixes do they have?
  b) What labels do they have?

4. Don't delete the deployment.

## Solution

1. Create a deployment using `deploy/nginx-deploy.yaml`.

```console
$ kubectl create -f deploy/nginx-deploy.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

2. Investigate created ReplicaSet:

```console
$ kubectl get rs --show-labels -o wide
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE   CONTAINERS   IMAGES         SELECTOR                                 LABELS
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5   3         3         3       37s   nginx        nginx:1.14.2   app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5   app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5
```

a) Put attention on the ReplicaSet name. What is its suffix? Is it the same `66b6c48dd5`? Why?

The suffix is the same because the Pod template the same.

b) What labels does it have?

ReplicaSet has labels `app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5`.

3. Investigate created Pods:

```console
$ kubectl get pod --show-labels
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5-jfmvk   1/1     Running   0          49s   app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5-lqqsb   1/1     Running   0          49s   app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5
nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5-xr95j   1/1     Running   0          49s   app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5
```

a) What suffixes do they have?

Pod name consists of two parts:

- `nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5` is ReplicaSet's name
- `-jfmvk` is random string

b) What labels do they have?

Pods have labels `app=nginx,pod-template-hash=66b6c48dd5` as ReplicaSet's selector (see above).
