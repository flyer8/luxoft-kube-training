# Deployment Updates

1. Scale the Deployment to 10 replicas in advance:

```console
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=10
```

2. Consider the following updates of container's image along with different parameters of update strategy:

  a) maxSurge: 100%, maxUnavailable: 0%, image=1.16.1
  b) maxSurge: 0%, maxUnavailable: 100%, image=1.18.0
  c) maxSurge: 20%, maxUnavailable: 60%, image=1.19.8

ðŸ¤” How pods will be deleted and created in every case?

3. For every case do the following:

   a) Update a deployment specification and fill the placeholders according to the case:

```
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to <image value>
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 2
  replicas: 10
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: <maxSurge value>
      maxUnavailable: <maxUnvailable value>
  template:
    containers:
      - image: nginx:<image value>
```

b) In terminal window #2 run `kubectl get pods -w` or `kubelive get pods`.
c) In terminal window #3 run `kubectl get events -w`
d) Apply the changes to deployment specification..
e) What's the order of pod update? How do they removed and created?

4. Leave deployment as is. Don't delete it. We will use a chain of updates in the next practice.

## Solution

Scale the Deployment to 10 replicas in advance:

```console
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=10
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

Prepare specification for updates:

```diff
 apiVersion: apps/v1
 kind: Deployment
 metadata:
   name: nginx-deployment
+  annotations:
+    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to <image value>
 spec:
+  minReadySeconds: 2
+  replicas: 10
+  strategy:
+    rollingUpdate:
+      maxSurge: <maxSurge value>
+      maxUnavailable: <maxUnvailable value>
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: nginx
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx
+          image: nginx:<image value>
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
```

Case a) maxSurge: 100%, maxUnavailable: 0%, image=1.16.1

```diff
 # deploy-update/nginx-deploy-custom1.yaml
 apiVersion: apps/v1
 kind: Deployment
 metadata:
   name: nginx-deployment
   annotations:
-    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to <image value>
+    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to 1.16.1
 spec:
   minReadySeconds: 2
   replicas: 10
   strategy:
     rollingUpdate:
-      maxSurge: <maxSurge value>
-      maxUnavailable: <maxUnvailable value>
+      maxSurge: 100%
+      maxUnavailable: 0%
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: nginx
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx
-          image: nginx:<image value>
+          image: nginx:1.16.1
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
```

It starts new 10 pods (`100%`) and when any new one has started, an old one has terminated:

```console
$ kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment
...
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  28s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-559d658b74 to 10
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  18s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5 to 8
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  17s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5 to 5
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  15s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-66b6c48dd5 to 0
```

Case b) maxSurge: 0%, maxUnavailable: 100%, image=1.18.0

```diff
 # deploy-update/nginx-deploy-custom2.yaml
 apiVersion: apps/v1
 kind: Deployment
 metadata:
   name: nginx-deployment
   annotations:
-    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to 1.16.1
+    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to 1.18.0
 spec:
   minReadySeconds: 2
   replicas: 10
   strategy:
     rollingUpdate:
-      maxSurge: 100%
-      maxUnavailable: 0%
+      maxSurge: 0%
+      maxUnavailable: 100%
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: nginx
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx
-          image: nginx:1.16.1
+          image: nginx:1.18.0
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
```

It terminates all old pods and while they are terminating, Kubernetes start creating new ones:

```console
$ kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment
...
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  5m31s  deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-559d658b74 to 0
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  5m31s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9 to 10
```

Case c) maxSurge: 20%, maxUnavailable: 60%, image=1.19.8

```diff
 # deploy-update/nginx-deploy-custom3.yaml
 apiVersion: apps/v1
 kind: Deployment
 metadata:
   name: nginx-deployment
   annotations:
-    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to 1.18.0
+    kubernetes.io/change-cause: image updated to 1.19.6
 spec:
   minReadySeconds: 2
   replicas: 10
   strategy:
     rollingUpdate:
-      maxSurge: 0%
-      maxUnavailable: 100%
+      maxSurge: 20%
+      maxUnavailable: 20%
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: nginx
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx
-          image: nginx:1.18.0
+          image: nginx:1.19.6
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
```

It creates 2 new pods, then delete 2 old pods:

```console
$ kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment
...
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  26s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d to 2
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  26s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9 to 8
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  26s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d to 4
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  20s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9 to 4
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  20s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d to 8
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  12s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9 to 1
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  12s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-76ccf9dd9d to 10
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  11s   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-67dfd6c8f9 to 0
```

Also useful to see results using rollout status:

```console
$ kubectl rollout status deploy/nginx-deployment
