# Readiness Probe

1. Get familiar with `pods/probes/probe-readiness-task.yaml`.

2. Start Pod and check the its status in colsole:

```console
$ kubectl create -f pods/probes/probe-readiness-task.yaml
replicaset.apps/probe-readiness-rs created
service/probe-readiness-svc created
```

3. Check logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs -l app=probe-readiness-pod -f
Healthy for 21 seconds
Unhealthy for 27 seconds
Healthy for 25 seconds
Unhealthy for 22 seconds
...
```

4. Run in another terminal run command to watch pods for service:

```console
$ kubectl get ep probe-readiness-svc -w
```

Check how endpoint appears and disappears.

5. Stop by pressing `Ctrl+C` in both terminals and clean up:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f pods/probes/probe-readiness-task.yaml
replicaset.apps "probe-readiness-rs" deleted
service "probe-readiness-svc" deleted
```

## Solution

2. Start Pod and check the its status in colsole:

```console
$ kubectl create -f pods/probes/probe-readiness-task.yaml
replicaset.apps/probe-readiness-rs created
service/probe-readiness-svc created
```

3. Check logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs -l app=probe-readiness-pod -f
Healthy for 27 seconds
Unhealthy for 28 seconds
Healthy for 27 seconds
Unhealthy for 20 seconds
^C
```

4. Run in another terminal run command to watch pods for service:

Check how endpoint appears and disappears.

```console
$ kubectl get ep probe-readiness-svc -w
NAME                  ENDPOINTS         AGE
probe-readiness-svc   172.17.0.5:8000   12s
probe-readiness-svc                     41s
probe-readiness-svc   172.17.0.5:8000   56s
probe-readiness-svc                     96s
```

Yes, it appears and disappears occasionally.

5. Stop by pressing `Ctrl+C` in both terminals and clean up:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f pods/probes/probe-readiness-task.yaml
replicaset.apps "probe-readiness-rs" deleted
service "probe-readiness-svc" deleted
```
